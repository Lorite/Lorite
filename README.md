### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alejandro Lorite Mora, or just Lorite if you wish :bowtie:. I'm working for Mobile Industrial Robots (MiR) in Odense, Denmark since September 2022. I work in the robot R&D department is responsible for providing the hardware layer interface abstraction for the higher architectural layers. My role involves all aspects of software development from technical specification to concept development, design, implementation, testing and technical documentation in an international agile team.

I finished my studies in July 2022. I studied an Erasmus Mundus (yay Europe!!!) Master's Degree on Advanced Robotics in France :fr: and Japan :jp:. I have studied a 5-year Double Bachelor's Degree in Bilbao :es: on Computer Engineering and Electronics Engineering :sunglasses:.

**Feel free to check [my personal learning repository](https://github.com/Lorite/lorite-personal-learning) where I put my learnings about anything related to engineering after my studies. There's not only code but also a lot of CI/CD implemented using GitHub actions and projects.**
