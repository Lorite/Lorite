### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alejandro Lorite Mora, or just Lorite if you wish :bowtie:. I'm currently studying an Erasmus Mundus (yay Europe!!!) Master's Degree on Advanced Robotics in France :fr: and Japan :jp:. I have studied a 5-year Double Bachelor's Degree in Bilbao :es: on Computer Engineering and Electronics Engineering :sunglasses:. I'm really sorry that most of my projects are private, I wish I could show them to you but they are kinda secret (and others are very old with ~~maybe~~ some :spaghetti: code).

If you'd like to contact me just write me an email! It's :free:
