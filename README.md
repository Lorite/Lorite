### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alejandro Lorite Mora, or just Lorite if you wish :bowtie:.  I am currently working on and studying an Industrial PhD at the IT University of Copenhagen in collaboration with Helix Lab and a multinational Danish corporation. I am working on multi-robot collaboration for industrial applications.

From September 2022 to February 2025, I worked as a robotics software engineer at Mobile Industrial Robots A/S (MiR) in the R&D department. I contributed to the full software development lifecycle of cutting-edge robotics solutions within an international Agile team, specializing in hardware abstraction, embedded, and computer vision. Among other things, I successfully implemented a complex 5-camera 3D vision system, managed cross-compilation from x86_64 to ARM, and refined point cloud processing for enhanced environmental understanding. I designed and implemented C++ and Python software components within a ROS framework, optimized CI/CD pipelines, and played a crucial role in the launch of the MiR1200 Pallet Jack, ensuring robust quality through comprehensive testing. I was also recognized with two internal innovation awards for projects developed during hackathons.

I finished my studies in July 2022. I studied an Erasmus Mundus (yay Europe!!!) Master's Degree on Advanced Robotics in France :fr: and Japan :jp:. I have studied a 5-year Double Bachelor's Degree in Bilbao :es: on Computer Engineering and Electronics Engineering :sunglasses:.

My main fields of interest involve projects where I can improve people's lives in the field of robotics. I thrive in environments where I can learn and evolve, both professionally and personally, embracing new challenges as opportunities for growth.

**Feel free to check [my personal learning repository](https://github.com/Lorite/lorite-personal-learning) where I put my learnings about anything related to engineering after my studies. There's not only code but also a lot of CI/CD implemented using GitHub actions and projects.**
